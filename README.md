# CP322-Machine-Learning

## Course Description:
With the rise of Data Science and Big Data, machine learning has been recognized as the key driver behind successful advances of these fields. However, many recent entrants to the field can only utilize the variety of machine learning algorithms as black boxes. This course aims to empower students to effectively use and understand the primary topics in predictive models, including regressions, classifications, neural networks and deep learning, ensemble-based methods, performance evaluation, etc. In addition, the course provides case studies that describe specific data analytics projects, and provide opportunities to employ a variety of machine learning toolboxes.

# Project: 
* In this project, we were interested in developing an automatic sentiment classification system that relies on machine learning techniques, such as opinion mining with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to learn from a large set of E-commerce women clothing product reviews to the five levels of polarity (strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive) as accurately as possible and label them with a numerical rating from 1-5 as this is a multi-class classification task.

* For example, "The zipper broke on this piece the first time I wore it. very disappointing." gives us a strong negative sentiment.

# Assignments
